HTTP/3 With Envoy Explained

1 min hook to today's hoot.

Why HTTP/3, how to test HTTP/3 with Envoy, and use Prometheus and Grafana to observe metrics? In this livestream, I am so excited to have Baptiste to join me to discuss HTTP/3 with Envoy and do a live demo of running Envoy with HTTP/3 and observing Envoy metrics.
