GraphQL for Developers or Platform Team?

1 min hook to today's hoot.

While GraphQL is cool in providing the exact data of what client asks for, does GraphQL help front-end developers or backend developers? What about operators? What are the challenges in adopting GraphQL? In this hoot livestream, Keith Babo is joining Lin to discuss the overall GraphQL landscape, challenges in adopting GraphQL and some innovative solutions to tackle these challenges.
